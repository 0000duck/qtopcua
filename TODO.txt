TODO: d pointer pattern missing. Also see QObjectPrivate pattern usage

TODO: about qopcuanode: to me this looks like a data value and not a QObject. Why do
you use QObject? Is the reason is QML integration then this should be done via the
relevant QML plugin. Otherwise you burden the QObject ownership problems upon the C++ API users.

TODO: about subscriptions: looks like value type. QObject required? for more details see my related comment in qopcuanode.h

TODO: check what encoding freeopcua is using for its strings. Convert with ::fromUtf8 or ::fromLatin1
and not with QString::fromStdString

- we need to document and/or add the minimal freeopcua version
  we can cope with (and if applicable for other SDKs as well)

- Document the MonitoredItem class

- ui Example + Testserver: leaving test server in stopped state, breaks UI when doing a new connection
  (actually I am not sure what triggers the server hang exactly, could be something else)

- QML example generates a lot of debug output

- We have our own "type" enum; could this be merged with QVariant::Type?
  compile with -pedantic -Wall etc.

- qfreeopcuavalueconverter.cpp: cases always isScalar()/isArray() -> fall through if neither??!

- sync.profile contains a dependency to QtDeclarative (presumably for qml-browser)
  Can we make this optional somehow or is this no problem?
